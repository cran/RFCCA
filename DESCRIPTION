Description: Random Forest with Canonical Correlation Analysis (RFCCA) is a 
  random forest method for estimating the canonical correlations between two 
  sets of variables depending on the subject-related covariates. The trees are 
  built with a splitting rule specifically designed to partition the data to 
  maximize the canonical correlation heterogeneity between child nodes. The 
  method is described in Alakus et al. (2020) <arXiv:2011.11555>. RFCCA uses 
  'randomForestSRC' package (Ishwaran and Kogalur, 2020) by freezing at the 
  version 2.9.3. The custom splitting rule feature is utilised to apply the 
  proposed splitting rule.
